# MDT
C++ Stand-alone library for Merging, Digitizing, and Triggering hits of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) based on [WCSim](https://github.com/WCSim/WCSim). A Python interface is optionally provided, requiring pre-installation of [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html).

The library provides C++ classes that manage three tasks:

 - Merging true hits (simulated photoelectrons by WCSim) of an events with those of any number of events
    - Intrinsic dark noise can be added during this stage
 - Digitizing true hits
    - Timing and charge of a digitized hit is simulated by a simple model used in WCSim
    - The library is capable of accomodating alternative models 
    - Parameters describing PMT charcteristics such as timing resolution can be varied
    - Digitized hits by PMT afterpusing can be added
 - Triggering digitized hits
    - A simple algorithm that counts number of digitized hits falling in a sliding time winodw
    - Selectable trigger window and thershold

## WCTE/WCSim usage
Simple runtime procedures. First set up your ROOT and WCSIM:
```
source your_thisroot.sh
export WCSIMDIR=your_WCSIM_installation
```
If `libWCSimRoot.so` is not directly under `WCSIMDIR`, export to `WCSIMROOTDIR`.
```
export WCSIMROOTDIR=your_libWCSimRoot.so_installation
```
Then set up the MDT environment.
```
source envMDT.sh
cd $MDTROOT/cpp; make clean; make all
cd $MDTROOT/app/utilities/WCRootData; make clean; make all
cd $MDTROOT/app/application; make clean; make all
cd $MDTROOT
# edit variables properly in run_test_mdt4wcte.sh
bash run_test_mdt4iwcd.sh
```

## IWCD usage
Essentially the same usage but with OD support.
```
# edit variables properly in run_test_mdt4iwcd.sh
bash run_test_mdt4iwcd.sh
```

## IWCD pile-up generation
Example usage
```
$MDTROOT/app/application/appGenPileUpSpill $MDTROOT/example/genPileUpConfig.txt
```
The application generates pile-up events by combining ID neutrino interaction events and beam background events in a spill. 

Input variables are:
- `ListIDNuIntFiles`,`ListBeamBkgFiles`: list of WCSim output files for the ID and background events
- `OutFileNamePrefix`: output file name will be something like "OutFileNamePrefix".00000.root
- `MDTParFile`: MDT config file
- `InitialSeed`: Random seed
- `IDNuIntRate`,`BeamBkgRate`: Mean number of ID and background events per spill. In each spill, the actual number of interactions are drawn from a Poisson distribution, and interaction timing according to the bunch structure (see `BeamTiming` class under `app/utilities/WCRootData/`)
- `UseOD`: Process OD hits
- `NumOfSpillsSavedPerFile`, `TotalNumOfSpills`: output spill setup
